 A comprehensive gene discovery of CYP450 gene family in s.alatum and their regulatory mechanism in Lignan biosynthesis
 
1. Introduction

Sesame is an important ancient orphan crop of high nutritional value, is widely cultivated throught Asia and Africa out all over the countries. In sesame genus, over 30 species are most commonly cultivated edible oil crop species in the genus (Nayar et al. 1970).
